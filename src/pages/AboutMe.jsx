        Welcome! My name is Ivy. Iâ€™m a Full-Stack Developer,
        Illustrator/Designer, and Cat Parent. I always strive to familiarize
        myself with the latest technology to keep me up to date in the field and
        keep an open mind to new endeavors. I have experience in programs such
        as Adobe Photoshop, Maya, and After Effects as well as coding languages
        like React, Javascript, and MySQL.
        <span>
          When Iâ€™m not coding, you can usually find me drawing or playing Sims
          in my free time.ðŸ’–
