        Hello! My name is Ivy McCurdy. I am a concept artist and illustrator
        with a background in animation. I strive to familiarize myself with a
        wide variety of tools to help me become a well-rounded artist. I have
        become versed in programs such as Adobe Photoshop, Maya, ZBrush and much
        more! With a unique mix of traditional and digital mediums under my
        belt, Iâ€™ve been having fun creating unique pieces of artwork. Ever since
        I was little and could pick up a pencil, I have been breathing life into
        characters and stories. Whenever I had free time, I had my face pressed
        to a sketchbook. When I graduated high school, I went on to the
        University of Kansas to study fine arts before realizing my true passion
        was in animation.

        Two years later I transferred over to Johnson County
        Community College where I graduated later in the Fall of 2018. 
        As of
        2023, I have moved on to the world of Full-Stack Development to help
        round out my skills as a creator. To take a look at some of my most
        recent projects, click on the 'Work' link above.
