# Full Stack Web Developer Portfolio 

## Description 

As the Bootcamp comes to a close, it's crucial to showcase what I can do and what I've learned. What better way to do that then revamp my portfolio? 
With React now under my belt, I can now flex those skills and put my best foot forward. 

## Usage
![A header that says 'Ivy McCurdy' above with folder icons below that act as links. Below the folder you have a picture of the web developer and some text to the right](./public/portfolio-preview.jpg)

Check out the deployed site <a href="">here</a>!

## User Story

```
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
